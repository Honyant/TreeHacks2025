Project Brief: Investigating Offshore Finance and Tax Havens
Date: [Early 2015]
Lead Organization: International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)
Collaborating Partners: Süddeutsche Zeitung, The Guardian, BBC, Le Monde, and other investigative media outlets

Background & Rationale
Offshore financial centers and tax havens play a significant role in the global economy, facilitating capital flows that are often opaque. While these structures are legally used for tax planning and asset protection, they have also been associated with tax evasion, corruption, money laundering, and the concealment of illicit wealth. Despite past revelations—such as the LuxLeaks and Swiss Leaks—public understanding of the scale, mechanisms, and enablers of offshore finance remains limited.

Journalistic investigations have previously revealed that shell companies and offshore trusts allow corporations, politicians, and wealthy individuals to move assets with minimal scrutiny. However, critical questions remain unanswered about the networks that facilitate these activities, the financial institutions involved, and the systemic consequences for governments and ordinary taxpayers.

Thesis & Objectives
This project aims to investigate how offshore financial structures are created, who uses them, and what impact they have on governance, tax systems, and financial transparency. By examining available data sources, corporate registries, and financial networks, we will seek to:

Identify the mechanisms by which offshore entities are formed and operated.
Trace ownership structures to determine who benefits from these arrangements.
Assess regulatory loopholes that allow these systems to persist.
Investigate the role of intermediaries (banks, law firms, accountants) in enabling these practices.
Evaluate economic consequences for tax revenue, financial crime, and inequality.
